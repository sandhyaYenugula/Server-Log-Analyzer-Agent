# Title: Server Logs Analyzer Agent 
#### Sub-Title: An intelligent Multi-Agent that classifies Server Logs as Normal or Error/Issue and provides Resolution for Incident Prone Logs using Gemini & ADK

## Project Description: 
#### Intelligent Agent to Proactively identify Server Logs prone to 'Incident Creation' and provide 'Resolution' to Fix the Error/Issue.

### Problem Statement:
#### Agent to Identify Server Logs to be a 'Normal log' or as Prone to Error/Issue leading to Incident Creation. And If Error/Issue, then Recommend a Resolution to fix the Error/Issue.

### Details:
#### Using a simple JSON Dataset with few Sample Server Logs, built an AI Agent using Google Gemini LLM model, a structured Prompt with few-shot examples and Google ADK (Agent Development Kit), to have a Best and Appropriate Solution providing Accurate results to detect if the Server Log provided is a 'Normal Log' or an 'Error/Issue' that can run into an Incident/Failure. If the Server Log is Normal, a 'Reason' is provided and only for "Error/Issue/Incident" Server Logs, there is a 'Resolution' along with 'Reason'. Exploring on LLM Evaluation possibly and options to deploy my AI Agents Model.

### Impact:
#### Proactively identifying the Server Logs can help identify the Error/Issue in advance and fix it to avoid non-availability of the Applications to the users saving lot of hours of the effort of the team per day, preventing Server Downtime Incidents costing $5K-$50K per hour.
