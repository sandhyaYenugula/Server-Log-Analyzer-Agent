And If Error/Issue, then Recommend a Resolution to fix the Error/Issue.\n\n### Details:\n#### Using a simple JSON Dataset with few Sample Server Logs, built an AI Agent using Google Gemini LLM model, a structured Prompt with few-shot examples and Google ADK (Agent Development Kit), to have a Best and Appropriate Solution providing Accurate results to detect if the Server Log provided is a 'Normal Log' or an 'Error/Issue' that can run into an Incident/Failure. If the Server Log is Normal, a 'Reason' is provided and only for \"Error/Issue/Incident\" Server Logs, there is a 'Resolution' along with 'Reason'. Exploring on LLM Evaluation possibly and options to deploy my AI Agents Model.\n\n### Impact:\n#### Proactively identifying the Server Logs can help identify the Error/Issue in advance and fix it to avoid non-availability of the Applications to the users saving lot of hours of the effort of the team per day, preventing Server Downtime Incidents costing $5K-$50K per hour.\n\n### References & Resources\n#### Use of AI Coding, Google, YouTube, Kaggle, Gemini","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ⚙️ Section 1: Setup\n\n### 1.1: Install dependencies\n\n#### To use ADK in Python development environment, install ADK library for Python and its required dependencies","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# !pip install google-adk","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-11-30T22:13:37.546811Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-11-30T22:13:37.547200Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-11-30T22:13:37.552321Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-11-30T22:13:37.547153Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-11-30T22:13:37.551373Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2: Configure your Gemini API Key","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import logging\nimport os\n\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient\n\ntry:\n    GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret(\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\")\n    os.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = GOOGLE_API_KEY\n    print(\"✅ Setup and authentication complete.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\n        f\"🔑 Authentication Error: Please make sure you have added 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' to your Kaggle secrets.

This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n\n- ✅ Agent Development Kit (ADK) - (https://google.github.io/adk-docs/)\n- ✅ There are 3 core workflow patterns (Sequential, Parallel, and Loop) to co-ordinate the Agent-Teams/Multi-Agent.\n\n\n**The Problem: The \"Do-It-All\" Agent**\n\nSingle agents can do a lot. But what happens when the task gets complex? A single \"monolithic\" agent that tries to do research, writing, editing, and fact-checking all at once becomes a problem. Its instruction prompt gets long and confusing. It's hard to debug (which part failed?), difficult to maintain, and often produces unreliable results.\n\n**The Solution: A Team of Specialists**\n\nInstead of one \"do-it-all\" agent, we can build a **multi-agent system**. This is a team of simple, specialized agents that collaborate, just like a real-world team. Each agent has one clear job (e.g., one agent *only* does research, another *only* writes). This makes them easier to build, easier to test, and much more powerful and reliable when working together.\n\nDocumentation related to [LLM agents in ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/llm-agents/).\n\n**Architecture: Single Agent vs Multi-Agent Team**\n\n<!--\n```mermaid\ngraph TD\n    subgraph Single[\"❌ Monolithic Agent\"]\n        A[\"One Agent Does Everything\"]\n    end\n\n    subgraph Multi[\"✅ Multi-Agent Team\"]\n        B[\"Server Log Analyzer Agent\"] -- > C[\"Classifier Agent\"]\n        B -- > E[\"Resolution Recommender Agent\"]\n\n        C -- >|analysis| F[\"Incident_Resolution\"]\n        E -- >|resolution| F\n    end\n\n    style A fill:#ffcccc\n    style B fill:#ccffcc\n    style F fill:#ffffcc\n```\n-->","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img width=\"600\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sandhyaYenugula/Server-Log-Analyzer-Agent/main/Server-Logs-Analysis_Solution-Architecture.png\" alt=\"Multi-Agent Solution\" />   ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.1 Analyzer, Classifier & Resolution Recommender System\n\n#### Let's build a system with two specialized agents:\n\n1. **Classifier Agent** -

The solution achieves convincing accuracy through few-shot prompting, distinguishing normal operations from error-prone incidents with precise reasons—and targeted resolutions only when needed—reducing manual triage time from hours to seconds.​\n\n#### Key achievements include a minimal 30-line Python implementation, sample JSON dataset for rapid prototyping, and production-ready architecture deployable on Vertex AI. The agent's contextual reasoning outperforms rigid rule-based systems, handling diverse log formats while maintaining explainability critical for operations teams.​\n\n#### This project demonstrates practical AI Agent develeopment for real-world DevOps challenges, paving the way for scalable monitoring solutions that prevent downtime and optimize SRE workflows.","metadata":{}}]}
